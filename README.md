# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Using-Python
Heart disease can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes, medicine 
and, in some cases, surgery. With the right treatment, the symptoms of heart disease can be 
reduced and the functioning of the heart improved. The predicted results can be used to prevent 
and thus reduce cost for surgical treatment and other expensive,
This project addresses three separate questions relating to the nature and statistical 
relationship between the distinct locations of the data as well as some of the attributes therein. 

The questions are as follows: 

Question 1 - Does there seem to be an average prediction risk value of heart disease shared 
among the data, or does one location stand out from the rest?

Question 2 - Does the data reflect an increased risk for heart disease in older patients?

Question 3 - How probable is a patient in the dataset to have a higher than average risk of 
heart disease if their cholesterol level is above 200 mg/dL?
